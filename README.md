**Guess the imposter 3 of us know the word, one doesn't** - A multiplayer deception game built with the MERN stack and WebSocket technology.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Guess The Imposter is a social deduction game where players must identify the imposter among them. In each round, most players receive the same question/topic, while one unlucky player (the imposter) gets a completely different question. After everyone submits their answers, the real game begins - discussion, accusation, and deduction to find who doesn't belong.

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Room Creation**: One player creates a room and gets a unique room ID
2. **Joining**: Other players (2-8 total) join using the unique room ID
3. **Game Start**: The host initiates the game when everyone is ready
4. **Question Distribution**: All players except one receive the same question/topic
5. **The Imposter**: One random player gets a different question entirely
6. **Answer Phase**: Everyone submits their answers without knowing who has what question
7. **Discussion Phase**: Players discuss answers and try to identify inconsistencies
8. **Voting Phase**: Players vote to eliminate who they think is the imposter
9. **Victory Conditions**:
   - **Majority wins** if they correctly identify the imposter
   - **Imposter wins** if they avoid detection or if innocent players are eliminated
